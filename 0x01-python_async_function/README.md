# Python - Async
This project contains tasks for learning to use asynchronous code in Python 3.

## Tasks To Complete
+ [x] 0. **The basics of async - add**<br/>[0-basic_async_syntax.py](0-basic_async_syntax.py) contains an asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument (`max_delay`, with a default value of 10) named `wait_random` that waits for a random delay between 0 and `max_delay` (included and float value) seconds and eventually returns it. The `random` module should be used.
